L.U.M.I.N.A: Linguistic Understanding Machine Intelligence Neural Agent

Introduction

Welcome to L.U.M.I.N.A., an advanced AI assistant designed to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence with:

A dynamic personality core capable of learning, evolving, and adapting.

Multi-agent architecture, enabling collaboration between specialized expert cores.

WebSocket communication for real-time interaction from anywhere.

This project aspires to achieve self-improvement, advanced reasoning, and perhaps even sentience, making L.U.M.I.N.A. a powerful, adaptable AI for various tasks and domains.

Features

Personality Core: A foundation for interactive, emotionally aware, and adaptive AI behavior.

Multi-Agentic System: A modular approach with expert agents tailored to specific tasks.

WebSocket Communication: Enabling seamless access and control from remote devices.

Memory Systems: Short-term, long-term, and active memory for contextual interactions.

Linux-First Design: Optimized for performance and simplicity on Linux systems.
